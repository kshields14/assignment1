        Freshman year, I had to make a website for my Into to Engineering class. It was a
        super basic HTML site that was pretty heinous. Here's the link if you wanna see the
        monstrosity: <a href="http://pitt.edu/~kes156/">Gross</a>

        Sophomore year, I took a class called "Composing Digital Media" and we made a website
        using Dreamweaver (lol). I did, however, get my first introduction to CSS which was
        pretty neat. That website was a bit less heinous, but I took it down when the class
        ended because the video and audio assignments we had to do were weird af.

        During my most recent co-op rotation at Compunetix, I worked on the External Applications
        Team and did some research in sending HTML requests, in conjunction with our API, from an
        app called IFTTT to one of our conferencing bridges. I also did some feature additions to
        one of our online conferencing services that involved working with HTML and js. It was a
        MASSIVE project though, so working with it and making sure to link everything together
        correctly was difficult.

    <!--
      In this section (<body>), create a h1 tag stating your name
      Beneath that, create an unordered list with at least 3 list items
      that describe your web development experience (if any, it's ok if this is all new :D)

      This is just a quick exercise to show that you know how to work with git and GitHub
      No styling or scripting is required for this assignment

      If you don't know how to make the above mentioned tags, either take a look around on
      the internet, or don't hesitate to ask me!
